Nursery Database was derived from a hierarchical decision model
originally developed to rank applications for nursery schools.
It was used during several years in 1980's when there was excessive enrollment
to these schools in Ljubljana, Slovenia, and the rejected applications
frequently needed an objective explanation.The final decision
depended on three subproblems: occupation of parents
and child's nursery, family structure and financial standing,
and social and health picture of the family. The model proposed should 
be able to predict whether the nursery is recommended for the child or not.
